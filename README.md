# Project Name

jQuery Server Calculator:

BASE MODE: 
1. There should be two input fields for user to type in two values.
2. Each mathematical operator should have its own button (+, -, /, *)
3. When a separate '=' button is pressed after all data is provided by user, the input should be bundled AS AN OBJECT and sent to server via POST.
4. Also include a 'C' button that will clear user input fields. 
5. Logic needs to be completed on server-side (compute the math problems as appropriate). 
    A. Addition
    B. Subtraction
    C. Multiplication
    D. Division 
6. When calculation is complete, the server should send back the value via a GET request to client side. 
7. All previous input should be displayed on the DOM as a historical record (APPEND).
